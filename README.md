# ROSACIMBRA website

RosaCimbra is my mom and she sells accessories for <a href="https://www.thisisblythe.com/">Blythe dolls</a>.

Please share tips and suggestions on how to imporove the website!

## Notes

To make the website free and completely self hosted, I decided to store all media elements on a separate GitHub page, which is fetched via a AWS Lambda function that hides a private API for increased rate limit.

This solution is fairly hacky and works well enough, but please share if you are aware of a better way of hosting media elements online for free!
